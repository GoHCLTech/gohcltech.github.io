If you run into an issue updating or installing PHP from homebrew after updating to Mac OSX 10.10, here is the solution.

1. Make sure that you have the latest Xcode version 6.1 installed
2. Enable the command line tools
    xcode-select --install
3. Install/Reinstall PHP55. In this example, I’m reinstalling.
    brew reinstall -v php55 --with-homebrew-openssl --without-snmp
